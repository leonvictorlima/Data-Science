# Machine-Learning-Credit-Analysis

Machine Learning  is one of the current technology and is being each time more relevant around the world. Its application is conducted and implemented in a large scale as well as managed a revolution.

This project is to share some knowledge about the use of machine learning in credit analysis. The implemantation of the model is straight to the point. By the way, like any machine learning application, the crucial steps are followed. Here they are:

**1) Business problem:**

The big idea here and behind all sector and also familiar for each financial institution is credit analysis. How prevent whether anyone will be a debtor or not? How to identify whether is a great oportunity to invest in anybody's dream? That are some relevant question to be answered.

**2) Collecting the data:**

The data is provided with elemental informations which are used in credit analysis. The dataset is attached on here.

**3) Analysing data:**

Normally it is the prominient part of all data science process and some analysis are realized. On the other hand, the main aspect which is explored in this case study is related to executation of some prediction prototype. For that reason, this point will not be diving deeply.

**4) Feature Selection:**

One of the most important moments is feature selection. Based on our dataset the outcomes from any machine learning project, its capacity, is explored in maximum level with an excellent feature selection and it needs a strong workforce in order to fit it.

**5) The choice of Machine Learning Model:**

Our case study is a classification matter. Consequently the choice to estimate and come up with a machine learning model is going to be related to this. In order to intesify and get diverses results its approach is built by three separeted methods: Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Random Forest models.

**6) Training, Testing, and evaluate each of them:**

It is the main segment on project. The fundamental thing here is extract, testing and undertanding diverse options to analyse and interpret outcomes from distinct models applied. Particularly, the outcomes at this point is reflected of previous steps and when woulb be necessary change, optimize, refine outputs we must come back and readapt, modifie antecedent stages.
